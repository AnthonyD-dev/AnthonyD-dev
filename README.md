# About me

### before I start I just want to say, I use ArchLinux and Neovim as my text editor.
So, Hello! I'm Anthony or SeNocks. I like to create projects and coding has been a pretty big part of my whole childhood. I started coding when I was 9 years old and loved it ever since. You can see some of my projects I have recently started in my repositories!
